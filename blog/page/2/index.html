  <div class="entry-content"><p>After <a href="http://ankisrs.net/">Anki</a>, the best thing to happen to my Japanese is
the <a href="http://drmoviemethod.blogspot.com/">Movie Method</a>. Once kanji stopped
being intimidating and began to feel like a tool, Japanese really started to
&#8220;click.&#8221; But as much as I love the Movie Method, it does have its occasional
quirks.</p>

<p>This book straddles the line between a history and reference book. The early sections tend towards the historical&#8211;they describe how Japan accepted cinema and made the transition from traditional entertainments (kabuki and the like) to film. The later sections lose the overarching narrative and begin to read like a laundry list of recent noteworthy Japanese films and directors. There are short sections devoted to Anime and Japanese documentary, but they lack the insight and entertainment value of the first few chapters. Maybe that&#8217;s just the material that Richie was dealing with: a film industry in decline, becoming ever more diffuse and hard to define.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This bit of grammar seems quite useful. I picked it up from <a href="(http://www.japanesepod101.com/)">japanesepod101.com</a>&#8217;s upper intermediate 3rd season. It&#8217;s a way of stating a prerequisite to avoid some negative outcome. <a href="(http://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%81%A9%E3%82%93%E3%81%AA%E6%99%82%E3%81%A9%E3%81%86%E4%BD%BF%E3%81%86-%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E8%AA%9E%E8%A1%A8%E7%8F%BE%E6%96%87%E5%9E%8B500%E2%80%95%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E8%AA%9E%E8%83%BD%E5%8A%9B%E8%A9%A6%E9%A8%931%E3%83%BB2%E7%B4%9A%E5%AF%BE%E5%BF%9C-%E3%82%A2%E3%83%AB%E3%82%AF%E3%81%AE%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E8%AA%9E%E3%83%86%E3%82%AD%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88-%E5%8F%8B%E6%9D%BE-%E6%82%A6%E5%AD%90/dp/4872345894)">どんな時どう使う日本語</a> provides the following illustrative example sentence:</p>

<blockquote><p>野菜を生で食べるなら、よく洗ってからでないと、農薬が心配だ。</p>

<p>When eating raw vegetables, if you don&#8217;t wash them properly first then
pesticides are a concern.</p></blockquote>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2010-12-16-tekaradenaito.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Breaking it down a little:</p>

<p>~てから means &#8220;after ~ [verb in て form].</p>

<p>でないと means &#8220;if not,&#8221; so all together it&#8217;s something like: &#8220;if not after ~&#8221;
followed by some negative verb or unwanted result.</p>

<p>With that, I can make my own example:</p>

<p>この文法ポイントを勉強してからでないと、二級を合格できない！</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I started this on a plane on a whim, never expecting to finish it (it&#8217;s <em>long</em>). Yet I did finish it, and for the last month, it&#8217;s been consistently the thing I want to read most when I crawl into bed. You could read 1 or 2 of the interviews in isolation and not lose that much. In fact, there&#8217;s a lot of repitition: the same questions, similar answers, similar opinions. And yet, I&#8217;d say read it all, there is so much to be gleaned from the small differences of opinion, and there is an unquestionable common strand that ties the book together: a vision of what it is to be a programmer; a prediction for the future; a praise song for what&#8217;s come before and a fondness for the discipline that sometimes was so infectious that I had to put the book down and go tap in some code of my own.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I think it starts quite beautifully. Small and convincing, a poor man and his mother trying to leave Cape Town and escape to a nostalgic countryside. The details of the war are woven in so subtly, I was immersed.</p>

<p>Part 2 I don&#8217;t know what to make of: Michael leaves behind his mother, escapes into the wilderness, is captured, escapes again, grows pumpkins, slowly withers away until he is stripped of humanity and disappears in abstract ideas which I couldn&#8217;t quite grasp or follow - I was empty at the end.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>f you skip chapter 5 (the global warming chapter) then you have one of the most entertaining books I&#8217;ve read in a <em>long</em> time. If you include chapter 5 then you have, well, a controversial book about global warming.</p>

<p><strong>Without Chapter 5:</strong>
This book is crammed with juicy statistics and outrageous facts. The writing is snappier and cheekier than <em>Freakonomics</em>. The book is a bit like a rough pencil sketch: Dubner and Levitt seem to realize that it works better if not every detail is rendered perfectly. It signals to readers: fill in the details for yourself, not everything here is perfect, not everything here is true, <strong>see</strong> it for yourself.</p>

<p><strong>With Chapter 5:</strong>
Well, I liked chapter 5. It&#8217;s point of view is consistent with the rest of the book: people respond to incentives and don&#8217;t like to change their behaviour. If you accept that as your premise, geo-engineering starts to seem inevitable. Unseemly lifeboat that it is, I&#8217;ll take their argument that we should think more about what the lifeboat would look like, and build the best damn lifeboat we can&#8230;you know&#8230;in case Al Gore fails.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Sputnik Sweetheart</em> has some surprising similarities to the <em>The Wind-up Bird Chronicle</em>: even the metaphors are the same. Or are they symbols? Or signs?</p>

<p>When Sumire goes missing, K&#8217;s first thought is that she&#8217;s fallen into a well. You see the well in your mind, piercing the surface of the earth, connected to the core of an unknowing, intangible world that you don&#8217;t understand.</p>

<p>Is that the promise of Murakami&#8217;s novels? His characters with their telepathic yearning and entangled dreams feel analogous to the squirming I do in my own life. Perhaps it&#8217;s something which can&#8217;t be said simply, or can only be seen indirectly, like how you look at a dim star. It&#8217;s not even always clear to me that the star in fact exists. It might all be hype, or astrodust, or something.</p>

<p>I have been thinking about what exactly it is that Murakami does well. I am making a checklist of the things I need to learn to begin to understand.</p>

<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ll need to learn more philosophy&#8211;or more precisely, I&#8217;ll need to learn <em>some</em> philosophy.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ll need to learn more Japanese: this translation never felt quite right. Sure it&#8217;s hard to translate, and surely even harder from the non-orthogonal weirdness that is Japanese. <em>Sputnik Sweetheart </em>is a short novel, breezy and only affecting because it holds enough within itself to avoid becoming maudlin. It would be good to read it in Japanese.</li>
</ul>


<p>I can say only this about Murakami&#8217;s novels for sure: when I read them, I have thoughts that I otherwise don&#8217;t. I am troubled by things which normally seem entirely ordinary.</p>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2009-11-08T20:38:47+02:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Nov 8<span>th</span>, 2009</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The first Graham Greene book I read was the <em>Heart of the Matter.</em> I read it in 2006. It was before I went to Japan, before I had a real job, before a lot of things that make me me happened. It&#8217;s a surprise that I&#8217;ve carried on with him as my favourite writer now for these 3 years. I feel different in so many ways, but more or less the same about his books.</p>

<p>By now I&#8217;ve read all his famous books. What&#8217;s left for me is just to re-read, and then read the lesser stuff, and read <em>about</em> him. It&#8217;s the prospect of a slow death: I&#8217;ll grow bored, I&#8217;ll find new writers, I&#8217;ll forget what it was that he did to me or that I did to him which holds me so captivated.</p>

<p><em>Journey without Maps</em> feels like the beginning.</p>

<p>Greene writes about his first trip out of Europe: 350 miles&#8217; marching through Liberia over 4 weeks in 1935. He hires dozens of men to carry his belongings, catches fever, gets lost, loses hope, drinks and drinks and as is inevitable of an experience as large as this, he is changed.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s clear that he is rewriting the experience into a vision of his own liking: how it <em>should</em> have been, no doubt. He barely mentions his cousin - it&#8217;s him alone against the wilderness. He is enamoured with the idea of the explorer; like I am with that of the writer. There is a simple strand of empathy and understanding in him that - when he writes about the conditions, when he admires the beauty of the women, when he hopes for something better for the people that he meets - shields his writing from the shifting expectations of younger generations.</p>

<p>It is a good book to read if you like Graham Greene, or if you like to travel improbably, or if you worry and think and worry again about Africa.</p>
