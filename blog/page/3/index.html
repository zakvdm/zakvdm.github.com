  <div class="entry-content"><p>The trick to liking P&amp;P is to think of it as science fiction. Face it: pre-Victorian society is as alien as any amorphous hivemind lizardman colony that’s crept onto your bookshelf in the past. Like all good sci-fi, you get dropped right into the middle of the world. It doesn’t belabour the rules: it trusts you to figure them out for yourself. And you do, and after a while you even accept them, and later still you start to play by them. You accept that this is what passes for love on this planet; you laugh at the silliness of some; and you adore the insights of others. But like all sci-fi, the disconnect between that world and your own is too large: you see the lines connecting us to them interweave, but you never quite see the point. It might also be helpful to think of Mr. Darcey as a robot sent back from the future to destroy all spontaneity and joy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I thought of On The Road often as I read this. It has that same obsession with exploration; the induction of the reader into a new world; Mystery as a modern kind of Dean Moriarty; Kerouac’s wanderlust transposed as our lust—that’s all that’s left. It’s hard not to think about what The Game could have been: it could have defined us. If only it were a little better (or at least shorter!). If only Mystery crawled out of the pages more, infected us more. If only—for all its grinding—something better was forged.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong: it’s a book about getting laid! It’s funny and filled with juicy pop-psych tidbits. It has jargon and a nerdy obsession with procedures: algorithms for seduction. I read the first 100 pages without blinking. It’s only when it settles down to the business of becoming a novel that the target starts to lose interest.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I savoured this, managing to stretch it out over a few weeks. It’s better if you read it aloud; it’s especially good if you do all the voices—and try to find your own, not just ape the Disney voices. I was reading loudly in my best Pooh voice late at night, nearly naked under a duvet, annoying my neighbours. The stories feel wise, though I can’t say exactly why.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It begins quietly: just ordinary scenes strung together—each faints mystery, never resolves, never becomes truly strange, never clear whether dream or truth. The book asks a lot of you. It’s overlong and unpolished. It meanders. It doesn’t all make sense (at least not to me). Then again, if you pull away any of this, you unravel it all. By the halfway mark, I was in a fever. I began to see the world a little differently; it became harder to put the book down. The scenes from the war never quite fit with the rest, but they’re pure suspense and some of the book’s finest writing, and I liked what they had to say about the war, and about Japan. I felt a little used at the end—Murakami takes his chances—but I didn’t mind all that much. I’ve never been used like this before.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Once, this book felt like a personal manifesto. Now, it feels like a piece of nostalgia. Every year of post-Apartheid South Africa chips away at this book. It&#8217;s a book that will mean something to fewer and fewer. Already, you probably need to be Afrikaans to feel any affinity for it. The universal pieces are too obscured, too diluted by its flowery prose and incoherence and length. I won&#8217;t be reading it again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I hardly need to say that a book about war is depressing, but Max Hastings is depressingly good. He makes this squalor of men come alive—there are images stuck more firmly in my head now than any war movie has managed previously. It is not the sort of book you forget. It was good enough to leave me harrowed and subtly changed. It is difficult for a while to be living in Japan. I began the book worried that it would be too specific, too small in scope, too laden with details I don’t care about—I ended it wanting more.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This book got the format just right: the insightful, detailed grammar explanations also illustrate the nuances and variations in style of the various stories. It seems odd, but I learned as much about story telling as I did Japanese. In the end, I’m not sure if these stories quite convinced me, but they at least held me in enough suspense to get me through the book. This book beats working through a textbook any day.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I preferred The Third Man to The Fallen Idol, but both are suspenseful and entertaining. The Third Man especially has Greene being unusually kinetic (if typically morbid), and I’m now quite keen to see the film.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It was good to read a Greene novel with characters that, for once, were free of the usual crippling Catholic guilt. Aunt Augusta is one of my favourite Greene characters: she’s so manic, flippant and oddly wise.
Indeed, something of Aunt Augusta, and particularly her relationship with Henry, seems to have seeped out of her and into the whole novel. Just as Henry follows his Aunt across the globe without reason, simply because she is so assured that he will (&#8220;My Aunt made no appeal; she simply issued a command&#8221;), the novel’s plot too meanders, thrusts forward occasionally spurred on only by coincidence, happens upon as many dull scenes as it does funny ones, advertises its ending at length, and eventually is content to stop squirming and with a murmur, tie up its loose ends and settle down.
It is odd that this, one of Greene’s later novels, feels more dated than earlier works. In the end though, the change in Henry orchestrated by Aunt Augusta, from unbelievably dull to unbelievably cavalier, is—and all of this Graham Greene makes look effortless—so convincing that it feels nearly inevitable.</p>
