    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In general, idioms don't seem that important in Japanese and they tend to be quite dry. Here's one that's a bit more interesting though:</p>

<blockquote><p>気が置けない (ki ga okenai) - easy to get along with; approachable</p></blockquote>

<!-- more -->


<p>The meaning is a little surprising until you learn the meaning of 気をおく:</p>

<blockquote><p> 相手の気持ちを気遣う。遠慮する。<br/>
 To worry about someone else's feelings. To show self-restraint.</p></blockquote>

<p>In other words, 気をおくmeans roughly the same thing as 気を使う. In the case of 気を使う, I find it helpful to think of someone "using" up some of their "ki" worrying about the other person. This is a concept you see and hear a lot about in Japan.</p>

<p>So now the meaning of 気が置けない makes a bit more sense. It's used for a situation or person that you feel so comfortable around that you don't have to watch your every word and action. Here's the meaning according to 大辞泉:</p>

<blockquote><p> 遠慮したり気をつかったりする必要がなく、心から打ち解けることができる。</p></blockquote>

<p>So a 気が置けない友達 is such a good friend that you can really be yourself when you're around them.</p>

    <id>http://zakvdm.org/blog/2013/02/11/japanese-words-mutual-benefit</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This phrase came up in Japanese class last week:</p>

<blockquote><p>戦略的<strong>互恵</strong>関係 (senryakuteki <strong>gokei</strong> kankei)<br/>
strategically mutually beneficial relationship</p></blockquote>

<p>互恵 was new to me, and it sure seems like a handy word to have in the toolbox.</p>

<!-- continue -->


<p>Surprisingly, <a href="http://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/leaf/jn2/240752/m0u/">goo</a> has a definition for the whole phrase:</p>

<blockquote><p>安全保障・外交・経済・環境・エネルギーなどさまざまな分野で共通の利益を目ざそうとする二国間関係。</p></blockquote>

<p>Trying to explain the meaning of this phrase in my own stumbling Japanese led naturally to a whole set of nouns that use the "help" kanji 助:</p>

<ul>
<li> 互助 (gojo)   - mutual <strong>help</strong></li>
<li> 共助 (kyoujo) - mutual <strong>help</strong></li>
<li> 自助 (jijo)   - self <strong>help</strong></li>
<li> 補助 (hojo)   - other <strong>help</strong> (aid)</li>
</ul>


<p>There you have it. A little help in every conceivable direction (except maybe receiving help without reciprocating?). Nothing too surprising here if you know the kanji (which is precisely why you should!).</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Dirty tricks for writing better Japanese]]></title>
    <link href="http://zakvdm.org/blog/2012/12/04/dirty-tricks-for-writing-better-japanese/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-04T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://zakvdm.org/blog/2012/12/04/dirty-tricks-for-writing-better-japanese</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here's a nifty trick I've been using when writing Japanese emails, etc. Like
so many things, it uses the power of Google and is best explained by example.</p>

<h3>The Example</h3>

<p>Let's say I'm trying to write an email to a Japanese friend who I recently met
up with for the first time in a few years. I want to say something that
roughly translates to:</p>

<blockquote><p>"It was really great to see you recently in Japan. Talking and hanging out
with you just like old times reminded me of what a dear friend you are to me."</p></blockquote>

<p>A bit soppy, but it'll do for an example.</p>

<p>So I take a quick stab at writing this in Japanese not worrying too much about
errors for now:</p>

<blockquote><p>この間、日本で会えてくれて、本当に嬉しかったよ。数年振りでも、相変わらずXちゃんと話ができたり、楽しく遊んだり出来たので、やっぱり、Xちゃんは僕の心に親
しむ友達と思えたよ！</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, I fully expect my Japanese to be filled with grammatical slips and
nonsensical bits (history has shown!). Let's see if we can't improve on my
first attempt.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>The <strong>Method</strong></h3>

<p>The trick is to use google's quotation mark search feature. When you put a
term in " ", you are telling Google to match that term <em>exactly</em>. This is
useful, because it means I can take pieces of my Japanese sentence above, and
see how many times that exact phrase has been used before.</p>

<p>Okay, so first example: I'm not sure about the 数年振りでも phrase. Makes sense in
my head, but who knows, right? So here's what I get when I google for that
exact phrase:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2012-12-04-dirty-tricks-for-writing-better-japanese.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>172 million hits! If you google the same thing, you'll probably get a
different result (because Google just kind of fakes these numbers, I think),
but the important thing is I can see my phrase used in context right from the
Google search results page:</p>

<ul>
<li>数年振りでも変わらず</li>
<li>数年振りでも変わらぬ空気</li>
</ul>


<p>So I'm feeling a bit more confident in this phrase. What else? Well, the
Xちゃんは僕の心に親しむ友達と思えたよ is an obvious candidate. There's lots here I'm not sure
about, including the use of は, the 心に親しむ友達 and whether I want to be using 思えた
form of 思う (the use of the potential form of 思う is something I haven't wrapped
my head around yet).</p>

<p>But just googling "Xちゃんは僕の心に親しむ友達と思えたよ" brings back no results (not
surprisingly!). So what you have to do is trim it down to sub phrases. This
gets easier with a bit of practice.</p>

<p>I look up 親しむ in my dictionary (you still need the old toolbox handy!) and I
see that I'm being reckless with my particles. So forgetting about the 心 bit
for now, I google "親しむ友達" and google shows me the results for ”親しい友達" instead.
Neato!</p>

<p><strong>SIDE NOTE:</strong> Most of these results seem to come from facebook pages, but when I google:</p>

<blockquote><p>"親しい友達" -facebook</p></blockquote>

<p>I still get a lot of results. I also get results for "心から親しい友達"</p>

<p>Looking up 思える in the dictionary, it seems like it's actually a different verb
from 思う with a different usage pattern (なるほどね). So now I can google
"親しい友達に思えた" and "親しい友達のように思えた" and since the latter gets a hit, I'm leaning
towards that. I also try 思える instead of 思えた and I get a few more results and
I'm thinking that's probably what I want.</p>

<p>I think that's enough to illustrate the idea. After a bit more googling, I
finally settle on this:</p>

<blockquote><p>この間、日本で会ってくれて、本当に嬉しかったよ。数年振りでも、相変わらずXちゃんと話ができたり、楽しく遊んだりできて、やっぱり、Xちゃんは心から親しい友
達のように思える！</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, this probably still has errors. That's not really the point. The point is
that it has gotten better than my original attempt! This may all seem arduous,
but in reality, it goes quickly once you've got the hang of it. Depending on
how important the writing is, you can spend more or less time doing this.
Plus, it's a good way to learn!</p>

    <link href="http://zakvdm.org/blog/2012/11/05/kanji-stroke-order-diagrams/"/>
    <updated>2012-11-05T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://zakvdm.org/blog/2012/11/05/kanji-stroke-order-diagrams</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="/images/posts/2012-11-05-kanji-stroke-order-diagrams-1-400.jpg" width="250"></p>

<p>Just a quick note for anyone studying kanji (especially if you're doing a variant of heisig). You can download a font which includes stroke orders <a href="http://www.nihilist.org.uk/">here</a>.</p>

<p>With a simple change to my Anki model, all my kanji cards now include stroke order diagrams. Nice!</p>

<p>If you're curious, here's how I changed the card:</p>

<h3>Back Template</h3>

<p>Include something like:</p>

<p><code>html
&lt;span class="kanji"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
</code></p>

<h3>Styling</h3>

<p>Include the following css:</p>

<p>``` css</p>

<pre><code>.kanji {
  font-family: KanjiStrokeOrders;
  font-size: 150px;
  color: #e56727;
}
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>This is for Anki 2.0 by the way, but you could do something similar with
earlier versions. The only really critical part is setting the font-family to
KanjiStrokeOrders.</p>

    <id>http://zakvdm.org/blog/2012/09/19/haruki-murakamis-short-stories---tv-people</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm finally getting to the point where I can start to read a bit of Japanese.
That is, I can follow the gist of what I read without constant interruption to
look up words and kanji. Actually, I've been actively resisting using the
dictionary. That's just not how I read English when I was a kid; and that's
not fun and not the way to stay motivated!</p>

<p>I've been reading short stories by Haruki Murakami. I've got two of his short
story collections, <em>Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman</em> and <em>The Elephant Vanishes</em>.
At first I went through and read all the super short stories. Ten pages or
less was my rule. I find that I can get through these in a single sitting.
They're a nice size, but the stories aren't all that satisfying. Usually no
real plot or character development. What do you expect in 10 pages, right?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><em>TV People</em> was the first Murakami story published in the New Yorker. I
usually enjoy me a good New Yorker short story, so I was curious to see what a
Murakami New Yorker story looks like. <em>TV People</em> is more satisfying than the
super short stories I've been reading. There's (a bit of) a plot, and you get
to spend some time with the protagonist. Honestly though, I don't like it. I
don't understand it, is another way to word it. To me this story is just a
vague ennui / apathy metaphor blah blah blah. In reading through these
Murakami stories, the cover of my childhood copy of <em>The Emperor's New
Clothes</em> flashes into my head over and over. Presumably the clever people at
the New Yorker know something that I don't, and there really is a <em>there</em>
there in there somewhere, but beats me if I can find it.</p>

<p>On the upside, Murakami is great for students of Japanese (like me!). It's so
accessible, it can give you a false sense of confidence. I sometimes go
paragraphs and paragraphs knowing every word, feeling really good about my
Japanese. That is, until I pick up a newspaper or even a tricky children's
book. There were a few passages in <em>TV People</em> that I found tricky, but most
of it was straightforward.</p>

<p>Reading Alfred Birnbaum's translation of <em>TV People</em> from the New Yorker, you
really get a sense of how simple the language is. I almost feel as if, in
translating Murakami into English, the translator needs to doll up the prose a
bit to make it feel natural. But hey, I'm the one who thinks everyone's naked
here, so I would say that…</p>

<p>If you're just starting to read Murakami, then there are two kanji you should
know. Murakami <em>loves</em> these kanji!</p>

<h3>訊</h3>

<p>訊く・訊ねる is just a fancy way of writing 聞く・ 尋ねる (kiku and tazuneru). There's
probably some nuance I'm missing here, but anyway, you'll see this character
used over and over so best get used to it.</p>

<h3>眺</h3>

<p>Murakami's characters love to 眺める (nagameru - stare/gaze). This one is
actually a standard use kanji, but I didn't know it until I started reading
Murakami.</p>
