<h1>About zakvdm.org</h1>
<p>This is the personal blog of Zak van der Merwe. I write about Japanese, Computer Science, technology and, well, whatever else comes to mind.</p>
<p>I'm a computer programmer living in Cape Town, South Africa. I work for Amazon on their cloud computing platform. In my mid 20s, I lived in Japan for a couple of years, and I've had an interest in the country and the language ever since.</p>
