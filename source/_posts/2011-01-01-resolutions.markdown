I never used to be one for making New Year's resolutions, but last year I made
some and now it's time to be held accountable. I made 2 resolutions:

  * Learn the 常用漢字
  * Do 100 Project Euler problems

<!-- more -->
So how did I do? I got through 1098 kanji and up to problem 63 on Project
Euler. So I failed at both. But I don't _feel_ like a failure! I was to a
thousand kanji around June when I realised that I was starting to know almost
every character that I saw reading newspaper articles during my lessons. This
is because I learnt the characters by frequency of use, and the 1000 most
frequently used kanji go a remarkably long way. So I stopped learning new
kanji and worked on vocabulary and reading. The point is, I suppose, that I
got what I wanted from the resolution, even if I didn't know what I wanted
exactly up front. (Project Euler is another story for another blog…)

This year, there won't be any Japanese learning resolutions. I figure I'm in
the habit of studying anyway… Instead I am going to try to write a little
every day (be it on this blog or elsewhere). Oddly, I know from experience
that this is something I find hard to do.

_Side note:_ I had a bit of a tricky time finding the Japanese for **New
Year's resolution** for this post title. It can be hard to look up phrases in
a dictionary, so in the end I resorted to [google translate](http://translate.
google.co.za/translate_t?q=new%20years%20resolution&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&hl=en&t
ab=wT#auto%7Cja%7Cnew%20years%20resolution) and got the right answer.
