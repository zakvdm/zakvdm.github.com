I started this on a plane on a whim, never expecting to finish it (it's _long_). Yet I did finish it, and for the last month, it's been consistently the thing I want to read most when I crawl into bed. You could read 1 or 2 of the interviews in isolation and not lose that much. In fact, there's a lot of repitition: the same questions, similar answers, similar opinions. And yet, I'd say read it all, there is so much to be gleaned from the small differences of opinion, and there is an unquestionable common strand that ties the book together: a vision of what it is to be a programmer; a prediction for the future; a praise song for what's come before and a fondness for the discipline that sometimes was so infectious that I had to put the book down and go tap in some code of my own.
