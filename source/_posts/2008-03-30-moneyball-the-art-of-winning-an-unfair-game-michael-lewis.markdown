I can’t remember anymore why I started reading a book about baseball—I don’t even like baseball. Once I started though, I could hardly put this down. It’s about the economics of baseball more than about baseball. As such, it did nothing to make me like baseball more, but everything to make me like Michael Lewis’ writing—with his knack for characters, dialogue, lucid explanations and great details—a hell of a lot.
