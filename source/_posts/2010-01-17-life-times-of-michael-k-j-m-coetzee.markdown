I think it starts quite beautifully. Small and convincing, a poor man and his mother trying to leave Cape Town and escape to a nostalgic countryside. The details of the war are woven in so subtly, I was immersed.

Part 2 I don't know what to make of: Michael leaves behind his mother, escapes into the wilderness, is captured, escapes again, grows pumpkins, slowly withers away until he is stripped of humanity and disappears in abstract ideas which I couldn't quite grasp or follow - I was empty at the end.
