f you skip chapter 5 (the global warming chapter) then you have one of the most entertaining books I've read in a _long_ time. If you include chapter 5 then you have, well, a controversial book about global warming.

**Without Chapter 5:**
This book is crammed with juicy statistics and outrageous facts. The writing is snappier and cheekier than _Freakonomics_. The book is a bit like a rough pencil sketch: Dubner and Levitt seem to realize that it works better if not every detail is rendered perfectly. It signals to readers: fill in the details for yourself, not everything here is perfect, not everything here is true, **see** it for yourself.

**With Chapter 5:**
Well, I liked chapter 5. It's point of view is consistent with the rest of the book: people respond to incentives and don't like to change their behaviour. If you accept that as your premise, geo-engineering starts to seem inevitable. Unseemly lifeboat that it is, I'll take their argument that we should think more about what the lifeboat would look like, and build the best damn lifeboat we can...you know...in case Al Gore fails.
