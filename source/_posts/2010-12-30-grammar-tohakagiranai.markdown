This is a handy bit of grammar that means something like "it's not always the
case that ~."

It seems like you use it when you want to point out to someone that a certain
expectation is not certain. For example:

> あなたは結婚するつもりでも、相手がその気になっている**とは限らない**じゃありませんか

> You might be planning to get married, but that doesn't necessarily mean that
your partner will feel the same, right?

On a side note, I used the Japanese dictionary
[goo](http://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/leaf/thsrs/17327/m0u/) to try and get a
better idea of the specific usage. My Japanese is on the cusp of good enough
to use straight Japanese-Japanese dictionaries. In the meantime, I learn quite
a bit by trying to use them, :).
