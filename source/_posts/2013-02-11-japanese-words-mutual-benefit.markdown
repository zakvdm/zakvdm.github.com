This phrase came up in Japanese class last week:

> 戦略的**互恵**関係 (senryakuteki **gokei** kankei)  
> strategically mutually beneficial relationship  

互恵 was new to me, and it sure seems like a handy word to have in the toolbox.
<!-- continue -->
Surprisingly, [goo](http://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/leaf/jn2/240752/m0u/) has a definition for the whole phrase:
> 安全保障・外交・経済・環境・エネルギーなどさまざまな分野で共通の利益を目ざそうとする二国間関係。

Trying to explain the meaning of this phrase in my own stumbling Japanese led naturally to a whole set of nouns that use the "help" kanji 助:

 *   互助 (gojo)   - mutual **help**
 *   共助 (kyoujo) - mutual **help**
 *   自助 (jijo)   - self **help**
 *   補助 (hojo)   - other **help** (aid)

There you have it. A little help in every conceivable direction (except maybe receiving help without reciprocating?). Nothing too surprising here if you know the kanji (which is precisely why you should!).
