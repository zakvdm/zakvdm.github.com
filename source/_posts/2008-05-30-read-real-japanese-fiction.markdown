This book got the format just right: the insightful, detailed grammar explanations also illustrate the nuances and variations in style of the various stories. It seems odd, but I learned as much about story telling as I did Japanese. In the end, Iâ€™m not sure if these stories quite convinced me, but they at least held me in enough suspense to get me through the book. This book beats working through a textbook any day.
