No back story, just realised today that I don't know this word. Here goes:

**妊娠**(ninshin) - **conception**

> * 彼女は妊娠したので、健康のことを考えてタバコをやめた。
> * 妊娠している

<!-- more -->
That's easy enough, but there seem to be a plenitude of other pregnancy
related vocab:  

> * 身重(miomo) - pregnant (kanji: body + heavy)  
> * 妊娠 - conception, example: 彼女は妊娠したので、健康のことを考えてタバコをやめた。
> * 妊婦 - pregnant woman
> * みごもる - to become pregnant (with various kanji I don't know)
> * 宿る - to become pregnant (also has other, more commonly used, meanings)
> * 孕む - to conceive / become pregnant

The list goes on. Phew! I still don't know which one to use. This has long
been a problem for me with Japanese: the dictionaries just don't get me quite
far enough. I have had the same kinds of problems with "give birth." Just
knowing 生む doesn't mean you can use it right. And looking for an example, I
come across this:

> 彼女に赤ちゃんが生まれる

>  She is going to have a baby.

Which may just be the best way to say "pregnant" after all.
