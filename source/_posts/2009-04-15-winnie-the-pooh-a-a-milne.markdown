I savoured this, managing to stretch it out over a few weeks. It’s better if you read it aloud; it’s especially good if you do all the voices—and try to find your own, not just ape the Disney voices. I was reading loudly in my best Pooh voice late at night, nearly naked under a duvet, annoying my neighbours. The stories feel wise, though I can’t say exactly why.
